Preamble
========

Nobody should only learn one programming language. Before Ruby, I wrote
things in C, C++, Java, Perl, PHP, and all sorts of things. I've always
said that I love Ruby, but maybe someday, something would come along
that'd be better for what I was building.

I'm not sure if Rust is that language yet, but it is damn interesting.
One of the worst things about Rust is that there's next to no
documentation, though. So, I decided that as I figured things out, I'd
write them out so that you don't have to suffer the way I did. Maybe
'suffer' is too strong a word; Rust is worth the hassle, though.

In this book, we'll talk about why you should care about Rust, how to
get up and running, the basics of writing software in Rust, and maybe
even something like building a Ruby gem with Rust.

NOTE: While this book is called "Rust for Rubyists," it should be
accessible to anyone who knows about OOP and programming in a
dynamically typed language. I will make analogies that will make the
most sense to Rubyists, but you can still get a lot out of this book if
you are a programmer of a different sort. If your favorite language is
static, then you're already ahead of the game. You can just disregard a
lot of the analogies.
